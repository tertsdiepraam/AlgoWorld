# AlgoWorld
AlgoWorld is an open-source collaborative wiki dedicated to documenting algorithms of all shapes and sizes.
The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive reference for both novice and advanced programmers.

_Note: This is very much a work in progress. Currently, I am dedicated to bringing the sorting category to a presentable state. This category will then serve as a model for other categories of algorithms._

## How To Use
Well, it's basically a wiki, so just browse through it! The subpages below are a nice starting point.

## How To Contribute
Contributions are currently made via pull requests on the GitHub repository. If you feel like contributing, there are several types of contributions you could make:
- **Knowledge**: edit the Markdown files to add or correct information about the algorithms.
- **Implementations**: add or fix implementations of algorithms in your favorite programming language.
- **Site generation**: help improve the site generation algorithm (written in Rust).
- **Design**: help improve the layout and styling of the site.

 _Note: The html files are automatically generated from the other files. Please do not modify them directly._
